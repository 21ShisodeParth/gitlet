# Gitlet
Gitlet was a project for UC Berkeley's CS61B (Data Structures) course, where I had to build my own version-control system, modeled after the widely used Git system.

[Here's the full specification.](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/materials/proj/proj3/index.html)

## Short Description
The purpose of Gitlet is to have a full scale version-control system which is meant to work on your local computer. 

Here are some of the commands (descriptions taken from spec. above):

###init
Creates a new Gitlet version-control system in the current directory.
